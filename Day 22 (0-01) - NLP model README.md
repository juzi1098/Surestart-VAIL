# Surestart-VAIL

This model used Flair for entity recognition (NER). The sentence "I like Snapchat but I prefer Instagram." was used and "Snapchat" and "Instagram" were tagged. This is very good since it clearly identified the relevant subjects in the sentence. 

One could make it even more challenging by including names and slangs.
